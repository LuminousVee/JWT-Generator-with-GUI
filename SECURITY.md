The security of this project is a top priority. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

You should receive a confirmation of your report within 48 hours. If you do not receive a confirmation, please follow up to ensure we have received your report.

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will assign it to a primary handler. This person will coordinate the fix and release process, involving the following steps:

1.  **Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions.**
2.  **Audit code to find any similar problems.**
3.  **Prepare a fix.** This may involve working with you to ensure the fix is correct and comprehensive.
4.  **Release a new version.** We will do our best to release a fix in a timely manner. The release will be announced on the project's releases page.

We will credit you for the discovery unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

Thank you for helping keep the JWT Generator and its users safe.
